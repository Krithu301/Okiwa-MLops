# 🧠 Okiwa – MLOps Automation Project

Welcome to *Okiwa* – my MLOps internship project where I automated the machine learning pipeline using GitHub Actions!  
This project shows how we can go from *model training to testing* with zero manual work using CI/CD techniques 💻⚙

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- ✅ Automatically installs all dependencies from requirements.txt
- ✅ Trains the ML model using train_model.py
- ✅ Validates the model using test_model.py
- ✅ Saves the trained model as model.pkl
- ✅ Runs everything automatically using GitHub Actions
